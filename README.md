# FOR BreastCancerAnalysis PROJECT

# This was a data analysis project for educational purposes at Boston University.
# The dataset was found on Kaggle, and uploaded by Nancy Alward, and initially produced by the University of Wisconsin.
# The data comprises medical scans from a group of patients who underwent a fine needle aspirate (FNA) biopsy. 

# The original unreleased dataset had an arbitrary number of variables depicting the cell nuclei in the scans. 
# Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:
# 1. radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
# 2. texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
# 3. perimeter
# 4. area
# 5. smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
# 6. compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
# 7. concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
# 8. concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
# 9. symmetry
# 10. fractal dimension (“coastline approximation” - 1)

# These variables were replicated into three categories of datapoints: mean, standard error, and worst values. 
# A decision tree utilizing logistic regression was conducted to reduce the number of variables to 33.

# For purposes of simplicity, man-power, and time limitations of the project in an academic setting,
# the decision to drop the "se" or "standard error" variables was made. 

# The project contains basic data visualization techniques used, as well as several typical machine learning algorithms
# used to determine the best model for the dataset, with accuracy score as the key metric to determine the best model.
